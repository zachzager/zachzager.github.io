		<h4>I was born and raised in Allentown, PA before moving to the Boston area to attend Tufts University in 2013. I am currently a junior studying engineering psychology. I love learning new things, especially about space and technology. My favorite YouTube channel is called "In a Nutshell". You can watch their video on quantum computers <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28'>here</a>. One day I want to be an astronaut like my hero Matt Damon. In the mean time, I enjoy going to concerts, cooking, and playing basketball. </h4>
